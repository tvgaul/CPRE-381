## DESCRIPTION: This file contains a do file for the testbench for the 
##              tb_mux2t1 unit. It adds some useful signals for testing
##              functionality and debugging the system. It also formats
##              the waveform and runs the simulation.
##

# recompile all source code
vcom ../src/*.vhd

# start simulation
vsim work.tb_mux2t1

# Add the standard, non-data clock and reset input signals.
# add wave -noupdate -divider {Standard Inputs}
# add wave -noupdate -label CLK /FILENAME/CLK
# add wave -noupdate -label reset /FILENAME/reset

# Add data inputs that are specific to this design. These are the ones set during our test cases.
# Note that I've set the radix to unsigned, meaning that the values in the waveform will be displayed
# as unsigned decimal values. This may be more convenient for your debugging. However, you should be
# careful to look at the radix specifier (e.g., the decimal value 32'd10 is the same as the hexidecimal
# value 32'hA.
add wave -noupdate -divider {Data Inputs}
add wave -noupdate -radix unsigned /tb_mux2t1/s_i_S
add wave -noupdate -radix unsigned /tb_mux2t1/s_i_D1
add wave -noupdate -radix unsigned /tb_mux2t1/s_i_D0

# Add data outputs that are specific to this design. These are the ones that we'll check for correctness.
add wave -noupdate -divider {Data Outputs}
add wave -noupdate -radix unsigned /tb_mux2t1/s_o_O

# Add some internal signals. As you debug you will likely want to trace the origin of signals
# back through your design hierarchy which will require you to add signals from within sub-components.
# These are provided just to illustrate how to do this. Note that any signals that are not added to
# the wave prior to the run command may not have their values stored during simulation. Therefore, if
# you decided to add them after simulation they will appear as blank.
# Note that I've left the radix of these signals set to the default, which, for me, is hexidecimal.
