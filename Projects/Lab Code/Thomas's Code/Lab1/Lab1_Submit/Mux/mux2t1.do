# Add some internal signals. As you debug you will likely want to trace the origin of signals
# back through your design hierarchy which will require you to add signals from within sub-components.
# These are provided just to illustrate how to do this. Note that any signals that are not added to
# the wave prior to the run command may not have their values stored during simulation. Therefore, if
# you decided to add them after simulation they will appear as blank.
# Note that I've left the radix of these signals set to the default, which, for me, is hexidecimal.
